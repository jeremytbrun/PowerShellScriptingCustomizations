# WindowsTerminalCustomization

My Windows Terminal profile uses the [CaskaydiaCove NF](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/tree/master/patched-fonts/CascadiaCode) font from Nerd Fonts.

I also ported over the terminal colors from the [SynthWave '84 VS Code theme](https://github.com/robb0wen/synthwave-vscode).
